# Handwriting recognition for medieval Latin
This study investigates whether operationalizing a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) architecture from recent studies produces usable transcriptions with expanded abbreviations by training on semi-diplomatic transcriptions that expand the abbreviated words.

We focus on the The Anglo-American Legal Tradition (AALT)â€”a coherent and extensive image corpus of legal Latin manuscripts that feature heavily abbreviated text. 


# Notes
The xml/jpeg files (to train on) should be stored in a directory called source.
